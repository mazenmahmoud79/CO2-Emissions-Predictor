# CO2-Emissions-Predictor
Predicting CO2 emissions using Linear Regression with scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.

Name: CO2 Emissions Predictor

Description:
Predicting CO2 emissions using Linear Regression with scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.

Project Overview:
This project utilizes the power of linear regression to predict CO2 emissions based on engine size. The implementation is done using popular Python libraries like scikit-learn for machine learning, numpy for numerical computations, pandas for data handling, and matplotlib for data visualization.

Features:

Train a linear regression model on a dataset of engine sizes and corresponding CO2 emissions.
Predict CO2 emissions for new engine size inputs.
Visualize the dataset and regression line to gain insights.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Showcase how to make data-driven decisions to reduce emissions based on the model predictions.
